## Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning models in text classification, particularly for spam detection. The models were trained and evaluated on real-world datasets to predict whether a given message is spam or not.

---

## Datasets
The project uses the following datasets:
1. **SMS Spam Collection**: A collection of SMS messages tagged as spam or ham.
2. **Spam-Ham Dataset**: Contains labeled text data for spam and ham classification.
3. **Spambase Dataset**: Features extracted from email data, categorized into spam or non-spam.

These datasets are included repository

## Results
- Models were evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization charts demonstrate the performance of each model.
- Detailed results can be found in the `Spam Detection Report.pdf`.
